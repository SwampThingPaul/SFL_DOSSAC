	abstract = {Many environmental regulations contain references to statistics and statistical methods, presumably because regulatory agencies want decisions to be objective and offer high odds in favor of making the correct decision. This is not achieved automatically by invoking statistical methods; it requires understanding the precision (variability) of statistical estimates and the way in which this precision translates to the probability of making wrong decisions. This article contributes to understanding the precision and performance of decision rules in the context of using an extreme sample percentile (for example, 90th, 95th, or 99th). Specific examples are based on the 99th percentile, which is shown to have poor precision whether estimated using a parametric or nonparametric method. The precision of the estimate will improve as the sample size is increased, but theory and simulations show that even large samples generate wrong decisions unless a range of outcomes is treated as indecisive. The inherent imprecision of estimates of the 99th percentile will be manifested in high risks of wrong decisions being lodged against both the government and the discharger. The risk of making wrong decisions can be lowered by writing a regulation based on a lower percentile. There is, consequently, considerable mutual interest and benefit in dischargers and regulators learning about the properties of statistics to be used in decision rules. Selecting parameters on which decisions will be based is an important part of writing a rule. The precision of the statistic and the operating characteristic curve can be used to evaluate the performance of a rule under consideration.},
